![solidfire-powershell-logo](../../Install/product.png) ![linux-logo](linux-logo-small.png)

The commands should be run in a terminal session on the machine where you want to install the tool. You don't have to be in a specific directory to execute any of these commands. You need sudo access. 

## Install PowerShell bits
###### CentOS
NOTE: The following steps ran on CentOS 7.3.

1. Install the rpm package:

    `#sudo rpm -Uvh https://packages.microsoft.com/config/centos/7/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm`

    Then install using yum:

    `#sudo yum install dotnet-sdk-3.1`

2. Install PowerShell:

   `dotnet tool install --global PowerShell`

###### Ubuntu
NOTE: The following process worked on Ubuntu Server 18.04. It should be similar with 16.04. 

1. Get the .NET Core SDK Package since the ubuntu package manger doesnâ€™t have any prior knowledge of it. 
   Download it using wget:

   `#wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb`
   

2. Install the downloaded package:

   `#sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb`
   
   
3. When done, install the .NET Core SDK with the following commands:


   `sudo add-apt-repository universe`
   
   `#sudo apt-get update`
   
   `#sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https`
   
   `#sudo apt-get update`
   
   `#sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-3.1`
   
4. Install PowerShell:

   `dotnet tool install --global PowerShell`

## Install SolidFire bits

1. Inside the PowerShell shell, install SolidFire PowerShell Tools for dotnet core using the following command:

        PS> Install-Module -Name SolidFire.Core
        
   The command automatically downloads it from the [PowerShell Gallery](powershellgallery.com). 

2. Import the SolidFire module with the following command:

        PS> Import-Module SolidFire.Core

3. To see a list of available commands, use:

        PS> Get-Command -Module SolidFire.Core

**NOTE:** This module used to be called `SolidFire.Linux`. That name has been deprecated and it is now `SolidFire.Core`

## Paths

* `$PSHOME` is `/opt/microsoft/powershell/[version]/`
* User profiles are read from `~/.config/powershell/profile.ps1`
* Default profiles are read from `$PSHOME/profile.ps1`
* User modules are read from `~/.local/share/powershell/Modules`
* Shared modules are read from `/usr/local/share/powershell/Modules`
* Default modules are read from `$PSHOME/Modules`
* PSReadLine history is recorded to `~/.local/share/powershell/PSReadLine/ConsoleHost_history.txt`

The profiles respect PowerShell's per-host configuration,
so the default host-specific profiles exists at `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` in the same locations.

On Linux and macOS, the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg-bds] is respected.
